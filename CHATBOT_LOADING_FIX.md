# Chatbot Widget Loading Fix

## Issue Resolved
The chatbot widget was not showing immediately due to IP address fetching timeouts blocking the initialization process.

## Errors Fixed
- `GET https://api.ipify.org/?format=json net::ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT`
- `GET https://ipapi.co/json/ net::ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT`
- `Failed to fetch IP` errors blocking widget initialization

## Changes Made

### 1. Non-blocking IP Fetch
**File:** `public/nexus-chatbot-widget.js`
- Changed IP fetching from blocking (`await this.fetchIP()`) to non-blocking (`this.fetchIP()`)
- Widget now initializes immediately without waiting for IP address

### 2. Added Timeout Controls
- Added 3-second timeout to IP service requests using AbortController
- Prevents long delays from unresponsive IP services

### 3. Immediate Default IP
- Set default IP (`127.0.0.1`) immediately in `fetchIP()` method
- Widget functions with fallback IP while attempting to fetch real IP in background

### 4. Improved Error Handling
- Better error messages for timeout vs other fetch failures
- Graceful degradation when IP services are unavailable

## Result
✅ **Chatbot widget now appears immediately upon page load**
✅ **No more blocking timeouts during initialization**
✅ **IP fetching happens in background without affecting user experience**
✅ **Fallback mechanisms ensure widget always works**

## Testing
The fix has been tested with the development server running on `http://localhost:5173/`
- Widget appears instantly
- No console errors block initialization
- IP fetching happens silently in background
